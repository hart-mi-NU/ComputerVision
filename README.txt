imgDisplay.cpp:
Before compiling the program, open imgDisplay.cpp and update the following three variables in rows 17-19:
	•	“DIRECTORY” 
	•	“IMAGE_TO_READ”
	•	“SAVENAME”
These tell the program where to look on your computer to open the image and how to name the saved image.


vidDisplay.cpp:
Before compiling the program, open vidDisplay.cpp and update the “SAVEPATH” variable (row 20) with the directory to which you want to save the images.
